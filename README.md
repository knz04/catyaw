## How to Run the Application üöÄ

To get Catyaw up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes with Node.js, or you can install Yarn separately.
- **Firebase CLI**: For backend deployment. Install globally: `npm install -g firebase-tools`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd catyaw
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    - For the frontend:
      ```bash
      cd client
      npm install
      # or yarn install
      ```
    - For the backend functions:
      ```bash
      cd ../server/functions
      npm install
      # or yarn install
      ```
    - Return to the project root:
      ```bash
      cd ../../
      ```

### Running the Development Server (Local)

#### Frontend (Client)

1.  Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```

    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Backend (Server - Firebase Functions Emulator)

For local backend development:

- Make sure your `server/.env` file contains your `DATABASE_URL` (if using PostgreSQL directly).

- Navigate to your `server` directory and run:

  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

  This will start your Express server locally on `http://localhost:5000`.
