## How to Run the Application üöÄ

To get Catyaw up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes with Node.js, or you can install Yarn separately.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable, otherwise, ensure you have all project files):

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd catyaw
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). The console will provide the exact URL.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command will compile and optimize your application, placing the output in the `dist/` directory. You can then deploy these static files to any web server.
